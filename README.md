Upon loading the portfolio, the user is presented with the developer's name and a recent photo or avatar, as well as links to sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact them.

Clicking on one of the links in the navigation will cause the UI to scroll to the corresponding section, providing a seamless user experience. When the user clicks on the link to the section about the developer's work, they are presented with a section containing titled images of the developer's applications. The first application's image is larger in size than the others to draw the user's attention.

Clicking on any of the application images will take the user to that deployed application. Additionally, the site has a responsive layout that adapts to the user's viewport, ensuring that the user can easily view the site on various screens and devices.
